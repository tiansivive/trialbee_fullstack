# React fullstack Assignment

**Instructions**

Clone the repo:

~~~~
git clone https://github.com/tiansivive/trialbee_fullstack.git react-fullstack
cd react-fullstack
~~~~

Install all dependencies

~~~~
npm install
~~~~

Build and run

~~~~
npm start
~~~~

it runs at `localhost:3000`.

**Note**:
I ended up using the boilerplate code from [relay-fullstack](https://github.com/lvarayut/relay-fullstack).
